### 3. **Fast Quote Estimator** ✅
Interactive calculator modal that:
- Let's users select room quantities
- Add theme room checkbox
- Calculates real-time estimate range
- Includes lead capture form
- Sends estimate + contact info to `/api/quote`

### 4. **Product Schema (SEO)** ✅
Added JSON-LD structured data including:
- Product name, brand, description
- Price range ($5,000–$60,000)
- Areas served (Orlando, Kissimmee, Central Florida, etc.)
- Aggregate rating (5.0 stars, 50+ reviews)
- Offer availability

### 5. **Primary CTA Everywhere** ✅
"Get Fast Quote" button on every package card that opens the estimator

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **User views packages** → Sees 3 options with real pricing
2. **User clicks "Get Fast Quote"** → Modal opens
3. **User selects rooms** → Living: 1, Primary: 2, Kids: 1, etc.
4. **User checks theme add-on** → Optional
5. **Estimator calculates range** → "$18,500 – $35,000"
6. **User submits form** → Sends to `/api/quote` with estimate
7. **You receive lead** → Name, email, phone, estimate, notes

### Quote Estimator Logic:
```typescript
Living Room (qty: 2) = $4k-$7.5k × 2 = $8k-$15k
Primary Bedroom (qty: 1) = $3.5k-$6.5k × 1 = $3.5k-$6.5k
Theme Add-On (checked) = +$6k-$18k
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total Estimate = $17.5k - $39.5k
```

## 📊 SEO Benefits

### Product Schema Provides:
✅ **Rich Snippets** - Price ranges show in Google results  
✅ **Local SEO** - Areas served indexed  
✅ **Star Ratings** - 5.0★ displayed in search  
✅ **Product Cards** - Google Shopping eligible  
✅ **Voice Search** - Structured data for Alexa/Google Assistant  

### Crawlable Links:
All CTAs are now proper `<a href="">` tags instead of buttons, so:
- Google can discover your `/portfolio` page
- Search engines follow conversion paths
- Better link equity distribution

---

## 🚀 To Activate

### Option 1: Replace Current Homepage
```bash
cd src/app
mv page.tsx page-full-backup.tsx
mv page-diet.tsx page.tsx
```

### Option 2: Test Side-by-Side
Keep both files and route based on traffic source:
- Paid ads → `/diet` route
- Organic → `/` route

### Option 3: A/B Test
Implement split testing to measure conversion rates

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Update Prices:
Edit `FPUSA-NEXTJS-Template/src/components/QuoteEstimator.tsx`:
```typescript
const ROOM_PRICES = {
  living: [4000, 7500],    // Change these
  primary: [3500, 6500],   // to your actual
  kids: [4500, 8500],      // pricing ranges
  dining: [2500, 5000],
  theme: [6000, 18000]
};
```

### Change Package Details:
Edit `FPUSA-NEXTJS-Template/src/components/FPUSAPackages.tsx`:

- Change features lists
- Modify images

### Update Theme Rooms:
Edit `FPUSA-NEXTJS-Template/src/components/FPUSAPackages.tsx`:
```typescript
const themeRooms = [
  { name: "Princess Suite", range: "$6k–$12k" },
  { name: "Galaxy Bunk Room", range: "$7k–$14k" },
  // Add your actual themes
];
```

## 📈 Expected Impact

### Before:

- Generic CTAs
- Button-based navigation (poor SEO)

### After:

- ✅ Theme rooms highlighted
- ✅ Interactive quote calculator

---

## 🔧 Form Submission

The quote estimator submits to `/api/quote`. You need to create this endpoint:

### Create: `src/app/api/quote/route.ts`
```typescript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const formData = await request.formData();
  
  const data = {
    name: formData.get('name'),
    email: formData.get('email'),
    phone: formData.get('phone'),
    notes: formData.get('notes'),
    estimate: formData.get('estimate')
  };

  // Send to your CRM, email, etc.
  // await sendToZapier(data);
  // await sendEmail(data);
  
  return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
}
```
