```

## 🚀 How to Use (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Import Component
```tsx
import WhyChooseUs from '@/components/WhyChooseUs';

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Other sections */}
      <WhyChooseUs />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Add Images
```bash
# Create directory structure and placeholders
node scripts/setup-why-us-images.js

# Then add 12 images to public/images/why/:
# - bg-01.webp, bg-02.webp, ..., bg-06.webp
# - mid-01.webp, mid-02.webp, ..., mid-06.webp
# (Also provide .avif versions for better compression)
```

**Image Specifications:**
- Size: 1200×800px each
- BG layers: Room/space hero photos (displayed at 10% opacity)
- MID layers: Vignette overlays or textures (displayed at 15% opacity)
- Format: WebP (primary) + AVIF (preferred)
- Use [Squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app/) for easy conversion

### Step 3: Done!
All interactions, animations, and scroll logic are built-in. No additional configuration needed.

## 🎯 What the Component Does On Scroll

1. **Detects** which card is closest to viewport center
2. **Updates** rail step with `aria-current="step"`
3. **Animates** progress bar fill and pin (0→100%)
4. **Lifts** cards with Y-translate, scale, and opacity
5. **Parallaxes** 3 layers at different speeds (8×, 4×, 1.5× viewport delta)
6. **Counts up** stats with tabular number formatting
7. **Reveals** CTA at 65% through last card with fade-in
8. **Detects** pointer position for magnetic CTA hover

## 📊 Technical Stack

- **Framework**: React 18+ (Next.js)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS (no custom CSS)
- **Animation**: Vanilla JavaScript + CSS transforms
- **State**: React hooks (useEffect, useRef, useState)
- **Scroll**: RequestAnimationFrame (RAF) throttled
- **Browser**: Evergreen browsers (Chrome 90+, Safari 14+, Firefox 88+, Edge 90+)

## 🎨 Branding

- **Primary Accent**: `#F16022` (orange)
- **Secondary**: `#E55A1A` (darker orange)
- **Background**: `from-slate-700 via-slate-800 to-slate-950` (dark slate gradient)
- **Text**: White/gray-300/gray-400 (high contrast)

All colors can be easily customized via find & replace.

|----------|---------|
| `WHY-CHOOSE-US-GUIDE.md` | Comprehensive setup, customization, troubleshooting |
| `WHY-CHOOSE-US-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` | Quick ref for devs: common tasks, code snippets |
| Component comments | Inline documentation explaining logic |

## ⚙️ Customization (Common Tasks)

### Change Brand Color
Find & replace in `WhyChooseUs.tsx`:
- `#F16022` → your primary color
- `#E55A1A` → your secondary color

### Adjust Parallax Strength
In `updateActivePanel()` function:
```javascript
if (layerType === 'bg') parallaxRatio = 8;  // Increase for stronger effect
```

### Change CTA Reveal Trigger
```javascript
const ctaRevealThreshold = 0.65;  // 0.5 for earlier, 0.8 for later
```

### Update Copy Text
All text is hardcoded. Either:
- Use find & replace for quick updates
- Extract to data structure for dynamic content

See `WHY-CHOOSE-US-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` for more examples.

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before going live, verify:

- [ ] Component renders without errors
- [ ] All 12 images are in `/public/images/why/` and load properly
- [ ] Parallax effect visible when scrolling
- [ ] Rail pin moves 0–100% as scrolling through cards
- [ ] Active step updates on scroll (aria-current working)
- [ ] Clicking rail steps scrolls to correct card
- [ ] Tab/Enter keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Stats count up when stat band enters viewport
- [ ] CTA appears at ~65% through last card
- [ ] CTA buttons have magnetic hover on desktop
- [ ] Mobile layout stacks properly (full width)
- [ ] No layout jank or CLS issues
- [ ] FPS smooth on mid-range device
- [ ] Reduced motion mode disables animations
- [ ] Images have proper alt text
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA

## 🚨 Important Notes

⚠️ **Images Required**: Component renders but looks empty without images
⚠️ **Directory Structure**: Must be `/public/images/why/` with exact naming (bg-01, mid-01, etc.)
⚠️ **No GSAP/Framer**: All animations are vanilla—compatible with all setups
⚠️ **Scroll Context**: Must be used in normal scroll context (not inside overflow-hidden)
⚠️ **First Load**: Preload first 2 images in `<head>` for best LCP

## 📈 Performance

Built-in optimizations ensure smooth performance:

- **RAF Throttling**: Scroll events run at monitor refresh rate (60 FPS)
- **will-change**: Applied to animated layers
- **Lazy Loading**: Images load when needed
- **Picture Elements**: AVIF/WebP with WebP fallback
- **Tabular Numbers**: No shift during stat countups
- **CSS Custom Props**: Efficient animation updates

Target metrics:
- **LCP**: < 2.5s (First image loads)
- **FID**: < 100ms (Button click response)
- **CLS**: < 0.1 (No layout shift)

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. ✅ Component built and tested
2. **→ Add images** to `/public/images/why/` (12 total)
3. **→ Import component** into your page
4. **→ Test on mobile** and real devices
5. **→ Monitor Core Web Vitals** in Lighthouse
6. **→ Deploy!**
