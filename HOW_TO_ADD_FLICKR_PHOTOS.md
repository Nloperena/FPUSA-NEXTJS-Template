# üì∏ How to Add Your Flickr Photos

Your Flickr account has **12,174 photos** available at:
https://www.flickr.com/photos/furniturepackagesusa/

## üîë Option 1: Use Flickr API (Recommended)

### Step 1: Get API Key
1. Visit: https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/
2. Apply for a non-commercial API key (it's free)
3. You'll get an API Key and Secret

### Step 2: Get Your Photos
Use this API endpoint:
```
https://api.flickr.com/services/rest/?method=flickr.people.getPublicPhotos&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&user_id=furniturepackagesusa&format=json&nojsoncallback=1&per_page=500
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual key.

### Step 3: Add Photos to Your Site
Edit `src/data/flickr-portfolio.ts` and add the photo URLs.

## üìä Flickr API Response Example

When you call the API, you'll get:

```json
{
  "photos": {
    "photo": [
      {
        "id": "52422920691",
        "title": "Living Room",
        "url_k": "https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52422920691_a68c04a151_k.jpg"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## üöÄ Recommended Approach

1. **Get API key** from Flickr (5 minutes)
2. **Call the API** to get all 12,174 photo URLs
3. **Copy/paste** the URLs into `flickr-portfolio.ts`
4. **Deploy** your site with all photos

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important

- Don't scrape Flickr (violates their terms of service)
- Use their free API instead (it's designed for this!)
- You can get up to 500 photos per API call
- Make multiple calls to get all 12,174 photos

## üí° Alternative: Embed Flickr

You can also embed your Flickr gallery directly:

```tsx
<iframe 
  src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/furniturepackagesusa/embed" 
  width="100%" 
  height="800px"
/>
```

**Your portfolio page is ready - just add your Flickr photo URLs!** üì∏
