# Integration Instructions for Albums 4 & 5

## ✅ Successfully Scraped:

- **Album 4**: Storey Lake Retreat - **59 photos**
- **Album 5**: Orlando Luxury Villa - **24 photos**

---

## 📋 To Add These to Your Project:

### Option 1: Run Integration Script (Recommended)

I'll create a Node script that automatically updates the file:

```bash
node FPUSA-NEXTJS-Template/scripts/integrate-albums-4-5.js
```

### Option 2: Manual Integration

1. Open `src/data/flickr-projects-full.ts`
2. Find **"// Highlight Project 5"** (around line 185)
3. Replace that entire project object with the Storey Lake data from the terminal output above
4. Find **"// Highlight Project 6"** (around line 204)
5. Replace that project with the Orlando Villa data from the terminal output above
