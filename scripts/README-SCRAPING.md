## üìÅ Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scrape-from-file.js` | Main scraper script (edit this for each album) |
| `album1.html` | Saved HTML (create album2.html, album3.html, etc.) |
| `src/data/flickr-projects-full.ts` | Final data file (paste scraped JSON here) |
| `WORKFLOW-FOR-REMAINING-ALBUMS.md` | Detailed step-by-step guide |

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No photos found"
- Scroll down on Flickr to load ALL photos before copying HTML
- Make sure you copied the COMPLETE page source (Ctrl+A)
- HTML file should be 300-600 KB

### "Syntax Error"
- Don't paste HTML directly into JavaScript (use separate `.html` files)
- Make sure to create `album2.html` (not `album2.txt`)

### "Wrong photos showing"
- Check that `HTML_FILE = 'album2.html'` matches your file name
- Verify `ALBUM_INFO.id` matches the ID in `flickr-projects-full.ts`
