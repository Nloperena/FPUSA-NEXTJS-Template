  💡 TIPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ You can paste just a few albums first to test
✓ Albums without pasted HTML will be skipped automatically
✓ The script extracts high-res photos (_b.jpg = 1024px)
✓ Duplicates are automatically removed
✓ Photo metadata (title, dimensions) is preserved

  ❓ TROUBLESHOOTING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"No photos found for Album X"
  → Make sure you copied the COMPLETE page source
  → It should start with <!DOCTYPE html>
  → It should end with </html>
  → Size should be 100,000+ characters

"Syntax Error"
  → Make sure the HTML is pasted between the backticks: html: `...`
  → Check that you didn't accidentally delete the backticks

"Only found 2-3 photos but there should be more"
  → Scroll down on the Flickr page to load all photos
  → Then view source and copy again
