## How It Works

### Desktop Scroll Flow

```
STEP 1: View Hero
┌─────────────────┐
│  HERO SECTION   │  ← Full viewport, headline + subheading
│ (scroll down)   │
└─────────────────┘

STEP 2: First Card
┌─────────────────┐
│ CARD 01         │  ← Sticks at top, centered
│ Title: "22+...  │     Scroll down to see wipe effect
│ (scroll down)   │
└─────────────────┘

STEP 3: Card Wiping
┌─────────────────┐
│ CARD 01 ↙       │  ← Slides left, fades out
│ (50% wipe)      │     New card appears below
└─────────────────┘

STEP 4: Next Card
┌─────────────────┐
│ CARD 02         │  ← Takes position, fully visible
│ Title: "5-Star..│
│ (scroll down)   │
└─────────────────┘

REPEAT for CARDS 3-6, then STATS, then CTA
```

### Key Scroll Calculations

```javascript
// For each card, calculate wipe progress
cardProgress = 0 to 1 as you scroll past

// Apply effects:
slideOut = cardProgress * 100     // 0px to 100px left
fadeOut = 1 - (cardProgress * 0.7) // 1.0 to 0.3 opacity
zIndex = 100 - (idx * 5)          // Stack: 100, 95, 90...
```

### Sections
1. **Header** (h-screen)
   - Centered headline + subheading
   - Animated energy line
   - Scroll indicator

2. **Cards** (6 × h-screen each)
   - Large faded number background
   - Bold title with underline
   - Description paragraph
   - Stat badge
   - Floating depth elements

3. **Stats** (min-h-screen)
   - 4 metrics in grid

   - Dark background

4. **CTA** (min-h-screen)
   - Call-to-action headline
   - Description
   - Two buttons (primary + secondary)
   - Animated blur backgrounds

## Data Structure

Easy to modify – all cards in simple array:

```typescript
interface Card {
  number: string;     // "01", "02", etc.
  title: string;      // Main headline
  description: string; // Body copy
  stat: string;       // Highlighted metric
}

const cards: Card[] = [
  { number: '01', title: '22+ Years...', ... },
  // ... 5 more
];
```

To add/edit cards, just update the array!

## Customization Examples

### Change Wipe Speed

**Fast wipe** (aggressive):
```javascript
const slideOut = cardProgress * 150;
const fadeOut = 1 - (cardProgress * 0.9);
```

**Slow wipe** (subtle):
```javascript
const slideOut = cardProgress * 50;
const fadeOut = 1 - (cardProgress * 0.3);
```

### Change Brand Colors

Find & replace:
- `#F16022` → your orange
- `#E55A1A` → your darker orange
- `slate-900` → your dark background

### Add Background Images

```tsx
<div
  className="absolute inset-0"
  style={{
    backgroundImage: 'url(/images/why/card-01.jpg)',
    backgroundSize: 'cover',
    opacity: 0.1,
  }}
/>
```
